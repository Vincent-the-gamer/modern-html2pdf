# modern-html2pdf

Work in progress.

## Why?

This repo is inspired by [html2pdf.js](https://github.com/eKoopmans/html2pdf.js), which uses `html2canvas` and `jsPDF` to generate PDFs. 

But there are too much problem with `html2canvas`:

- SVGs are not supported
- Custom fonts can't showed correctly.
- ...

These can be gracefully fixed using `modern-screenshot`.

So this is why I created this repo.
